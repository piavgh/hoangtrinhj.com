Iâ€™m Hoang Trinh, a web developer, technical writer from Ha Noi, Viet Nam. I currently work as a CTO for a startup.

This is my current product: [Form Publisher & Approvals Flow - PerformFlow](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/form_publisher_approvals_flow_performflo/175817313914 "Form Publisher & Approvals Flow - PerformFlow"), which has more than 48k users in just 2 months.

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned. I [love self-learning](/learn) and write about everything I know.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
