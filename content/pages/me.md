![Me](../images/hoang_cover.png)

Iâ€™m Hoang Trinh, a web developer, technical writer from Ha Noi, Viet Nam. I currently work as a CTO for a startup.

This is my current product: [PerformFlow](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/performflow_form_publisher_approvals_wor/175817313914 'PerformFlow'), which has more than 60k users in just 2 months after launching.

In my personal time, I try to learn as much as I can about Machine Learning / Deep Learning. Because I believe those technologies will soon change our world drastically, in a better way (but yeah, I'm also a fan of the [Terminator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)>)).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned. I [love self-learning](/) and [write about everything I know](/blog).

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
