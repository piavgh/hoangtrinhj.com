![Me](../images/hoang_cover.png)

Iâ€™m Hoang Trinh, a web developer, technical writer from Ha Noi, Viet Nam.

Recently, I'm building products on Google ecosystem (G Suite and Google Cloud Platform).

This is my recent product: [PerformFlow](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/performflow_form_publisher_approvals_wor/175817313914 'PerformFlow'), which has more than 60k users in just 2 months after launching.

I work mainly as a backend developer (Node.js, Golang) but I can also work with React.js. I've built apps with React.js for 2 years.

You can check my resume here for more information: [resume.hoangtrinhj.com](https://resume.hoangtrinhj.com).

In my free time, I try to learn as much as I can about Machine Learning / Deep Learning with Python. Because I believe those technologies will soon change our world drastically, in a better way (but yeah, I'm also a fan of the [Terminator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)>)).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned. I [love self-learning](/) and [write about everything I know](/blog).

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
